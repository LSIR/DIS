 
This course introduces the key concepts and algorithms from the areas of information retrieval, data mining and knowledge bases, which constitute the foundations of today's web-based distributed information systems. 

<!-- ### Final Exam:
The final exam will take place on **01 Feb. 2023 from 15:00 to 18:00** in rooms **CE 1515** and **CE 6**.
 -->

<!-- ### Midterm:  -->
<!-- The midterm will take place during the exercises session on **27 Oct. 2022 from 12:15 to 13:00** in rooms: CM3 (where the lectures are taking place) and CM1105 (this room will be used if there are no available spots in CM3).
 -->
<!-- The exam will be performed online on your laptop, with Internet access. **No communication using messaging, social media, email, or similar tools is allowed**. You can use your notes or any materials from the lecture during the exam. -->

<!-- It is **strongly recommended** to do the exercises, as the final exam will be similar to those.

**Absence**: You have to submit a doctor’s attest if you miss the final exam due to sickness. No other reasons for not taking the final exam will be accepted. 

**Irregular behaviour**: In case of irregular behaviour during the final exam EPFL’s standard policies apply. -->

## Projects [[video]()]
During the semester, you will need to implement 2 graded projects, regarding the following topics:
- P1: Text Retrieval 
- P2: TBA

**Logistics:**
- All 2 projects comprise **60% of the final grade** (30% each).
- You will have **6 weeks** to implement and submit each project (please review the detailed schedule per project below).
- You will have **5 late-days policy** that you can use in any project deadline throughout the semester.
- All projects will be implemented in **Python**.
- A **2-page report** of each project should be submitted in Moodle.
- Details for each project will be released for each project respectively.

#### P1: Text Retrieval [[video](https://mediaspace.epfl.ch/media/P1+Presentation/0_8jf49auh/29734)]
Release Date: **16 Sept**

Presentation Date: **19 Sept**, 12-13:00 (during lab session)

Deadline Date: **3 Nov**, 23:59.

#### P2: TBA
Release Date: **4 Nov**

Presentation Date: **7 Nov**, 12-13:00 (during lab session)]

Deadline Date: **15 Dec**, 23:59.

### Evaluation criteria
- **40%:**  Results - Metrics   [Comparison with baselines]
- **30%:** Code
    - Working code (20%)
    - Code quality and documentation (10%)

## Exercises
Exercises are **NOT graded**. We have released exercises for all topics covered in the weekly lectures under [this path](https://github.com/LSIR/DIS/tree/master/Exercises). Feel free to solve them since the final exam will follow the same format.

Exercises / Lab sessions will be allocated for questions regarding the Projects.

## Final Exam (TBA)

<!-- 📅 **Date:** Tuesday, Jan 30 (30.01.2024)

🕒 **When:** From 15h15 to 18h15

📍 **Where:** PO01 -->


## Communication Guidelines

**Q&A**: Questions to TAs should be asked **only** in the dedicated per-topic folders in the Ed forum. TAs will be available in the zoom session **only** during the exercise sessions. <!-- You can also send private messages, but this should be done only for questions that aren’t of general interest; otherwise, you **must** use public channels. --> <!-- Important **announcements** will be pinned on the **general** channel. --> TAs won’t provide answers via **email**.

**Best Practices**: Please join the Ed forum with your **academic email**. Before posting a question, it is important to check if it has **already** been answered<!--  in any of the group channels -->. <!-- Avoid using **@everyone** and **@here**; this will trigger a notification being sent to all the students and TAs. --> Set your **full name** as your nickname. Please keep the communication **respectful**.
