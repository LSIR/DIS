 
This course introduces the key concepts and algorithms from the areas of information retrieval, data mining and knowledge bases, which constitute the foundations of today's web-based distributed information systems. 

<!-- ### Final Exam:
The final exam will take place on **01 Feb. 2023 from 15:00 to 18:00** in rooms **CE 1515** and **CE 6**.
 -->

<!-- ### Midterm:  -->
<!-- The midterm will take place during the exercises session on **27 Oct. 2022 from 12:15 to 13:00** in rooms: CM3 (where the lectures are taking place) and CM1105 (this room will be used if there are no available spots in CM3).
 -->
<!-- The exam will be performed online on your laptop, with Internet access. **No communication using messaging, social media, email, or similar tools is allowed**. You can use your notes or any materials from the lecture during the exam. -->

<!-- It is **strongly recommended** to do the exercises, as the final exam will be similar to those.

**Absence**: You have to submit a doctor’s attest if you miss the final exam due to sickness. No other reasons for not taking the final exam will be accepted. 

**Irregular behaviour**: In case of irregular behaviour during the final exam EPFL’s standard policies apply. -->

## Projects [[video](https://mediaspace.epfl.ch/media/Projects+Presenation+%26+Logistics/0_rzxy388h)]
During the semester, you will need to implement 4 graded projects, regarding the following topics:
- P1: Text Retrieval 
- P2: Recommender Systems
- P3: Named Entity Linking
- P4: Relation Extraction

**Logistics:**
- All 4 projects comprise **50% of the final grade** (12.5% each).
- You will have **3 weeks** to implement and submit each project (please review the detailed schedule per project below).
- You will have **5 late-days policy** that you can use in any project deadline throughout the semester.
- All projects will be implemented in **Python**.
- A **2-page report** of each project should be submitted in Moodle.
- Details for each project will be released for each project respectively.

## Exercises
Exercises are **NOT graded**. We have released exercises for all topics covered in the weekly lectures under [this path](https://github.com/LSIR/DIS/tree/master/Exercises). Feel free to solve them since the final exam will follow the same format.

Exercises / Lab sessions will be allocated for questions regarding the Projects.

## Final Exam (TBA)

<!-- ### Exercises Session format (In-person):
- TAs will provide a small discussion over the **last week's exercises**, answering any questions and explaining the solutions. _(10-15mins)_
- TAs will present **this week's exercise**. _(5mins)_ 
- Students will be solving this week's exercises and TAs will provide answers and clarification if needed.
_**Note**: Please make sure you have already done the setup prerequisites to run the coding parts of the exercises. You can find the instructions [here](https://github.com/LSIR/DIS/tree/master/Exercises/setup)._ -->



## Communication Guidelines

**Q&A**: Questions to TAs should be asked **only** in the dedicated per-topic folders in the Ed forum. TAs will be available in the zoom session **only** during the exercise sessions. <!-- You can also send private messages, but this should be done only for questions that aren’t of general interest; otherwise, you **must** use public channels. --> <!-- Important **announcements** will be pinned on the **general** channel. --> TAs won’t provide answers via **email**.

**Best Practices**: Please join the Ed forum with your **academic email**. Before posting a question, it is important to check if it has **already** been answered<!--  in any of the group channels -->. <!-- Avoid using **@everyone** and **@here**; this will trigger a notification being sent to all the students and TAs. --> Set your **full name** as your nickname. Please keep the communication **respectful**.
