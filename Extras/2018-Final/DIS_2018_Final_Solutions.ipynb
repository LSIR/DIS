    "Assume we would like to identify Twitter user accounts $T$ that have interest in Swiss universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we have no training data, we analyse the social relationships of those users.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we consider that users that follow an Twitter account $S$ related to a Swiss University (e.g. @EPFL, @EPFL\\_en, @ETHZ etc.) show interest for Swiss universities. We assume that $S$ and $T$ are disjoint. We capture the follower relationship in a matrix $F$, where an entry $f_{ij} = 1$ indicates a follower link from user account $i\\in T$ to university account $j\\in S$. Otherwise the entry is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to assess the level of interest of users into Swiss universities by using two methods:\n",
    "1. The HITS algorithm, where we consider the Swiss university accounts as authorities and the users we intend to classify as hubs. A high hub value $t_i$ for user $i\\in T$ should indicate a high level of interest in Swiss universities, a high authority value $s_j$ indicates that university account $j\\in S$ is a good indicator for interest in Swiss universities.\n",
    "2. The EM algorithm, where we consider the existence of a follower link from a user to a Swiss university account as a positive feedback given that university account on the interest of the user , and the absence of such a link as negative feedback (i.e. we consider the university accounts like experts and the users like the item to be evaluated). A high level of positive feedback $t_i$ for user $i\\in T$ indicates interest in Swiss universities, and a high expertise value $s_j$ indicates that university account $j\\in S$ is a good indicator for interest in Swiss universities.\n",

    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Formulate the two algorithms (HITS and EM) using the following patterns for a recursive computation of $t$ and $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "HITS:  $\\vec{t}_{k+1} = r_1  M_1. \\vec{v_1},\\ \\vec{s}_{k+1} = r_2  M_2 . \\vec{v_2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "EM:    $\\vec{t}_{k+1} = r_3  M_3 . \\vec{v_3},\\ \\vec{s}_{k+1} = r_4 (M_4.\\vec{v_4} + M_5.\\vec{v_5})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{t}=(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)$ and $\\vec{s}=(s_1,\\ldots,s_m)$ are the vectors ranking interest and expertise of users and universities. Your task is to express $r_p$, $\\vec{v_p}$ and $M_p$, $p=1,\\ldots,5$ in terms of $\\vec{t}_{k}$, $\\vec{s}_{k}$ and $F$, where $r_p$ are scalars, $\\vec{v_p}$ are vectors and $M_p$ are matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use also the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\vec{v}|_2$ for the 2-norm\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\vec{v}|_1$ for the 1-norm\n",
    "\n",
    "$M^t$ for the matrix transpose\n",
    "\n",
    "$round(\\vec{v})$ for rounding the values of a vector in $[0,1]$ to $0$ and $1$\n",
    " \n",
    "2) For HITS: in which sense is the input to the algorithm a special case of the most general possible inputs? Which additional constraints does the formulation of the problem satisfy?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Assume after applying HITS or EM you perform a binary classification of the accounts by setting a threshold on the values in $\\vec{t}$, i.e., all accounts with a authority/interest value above the threshold are considered as accounts interested in Swiss universities. Identify and shortly describe a simple, standard classification algorithm that uses the accounts with binary labels as training data to classify new accounts and that does not require training (and does not rely on recomputing HITS or EM).\n",
