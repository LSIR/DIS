    "# ðŸ“š Exercise: Taxonomy Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this exercise, we will perform the various steps commonly employed for unsupervised taxonomy induction from text corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview:\n",
    "Taxonomy induction from text typically consists of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li><b>Relations Extraction:</b> In this step, we use lexico-syntactic patterns to extract <b>IsA</b> relations from text. An example of IsA relation is (<i>apple, fruit</i>), which implies that <i>apple</i> is a type of fruit.</li>\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <li><b>Initial Graph Construction:</b> In this step, we aggregate the extracted IsA relations to construct a potentially-noisy initial hypernym graph.</li>\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  <li><b>Graph Pruning:</b> In the final step, we perform some pruning or optimization steps to induce the a final clean taxonomy.</li>\n",
    "</ol>  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal:\n",
    "- Run an extraction of IsA relations using lexico-syntactic patterns and inspect the results.\n",
    "- Given the true IsA relations, construct an initial potentially-noisy hypernym graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are you learning in this exercise:\n",
    "You will learn about the three steps of taxonomy induction in detail in the rest of this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1 - Relations Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the exercise, we will run a small-scale extraction of IsA relations and inspect the results. Relations extraction uses lexico-syntactic patterns to identify IsA relations from unstructured text. Examples of lexico-syntactic patterns include:\n",
    "\n",
    " Lexico-syntactic pattern | Sample matching text\n",
    "  ------|------------------\n",
    "  <b>X</b> is a <b>Y</b>     | <i><b>apple</b> is a <b>fruit</b></i>, <i><b>switzerland</b> is a <b>country</b></i>\n",
    "  <b>X</b> such as <b>Y</b>     | <i><b>fruits</b> such as <b>mango</b></i>, <i><b>scientists</b> such as <b>Einstein</b></i>\n",
    "  <b>X</b> is an example of <b>Y</b>     | <i><b>iphone</b> is an example of <b>smartphone</b></i>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <br>\n",
