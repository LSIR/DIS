    "## Question 3 - Inverted Files\n",
    "\n",
    "We learnt in the lecture that terms are typically stored in an inverted list. Now, in the inverted list, instead of only storing document identifiers of the documents in which the term appears, assume we also store an *offset* of the appearance of a term in a document. An $offset$ of a term $l_k$ given a document is defined as the number of words between the start of the document and $l_k$. Thus our inverted list is now:\n",

    "\\{d_{i_k} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_k}}]\\} \\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that in document $d_{i_1}$ term $l_k$ appears $n_{i_1}$ times and at offset $[o_1,,o_{n_{i_1}}]$, where $[o_1,,o_{n_{i_1}}]$ are sorted in ascending order, these type of indices are also known as term-offset indices. An example of a term-offset index is as follows:\n",

    "Which is to say that the term **Governor** appear in 2 documents. In document 4 at offset 3, in document 7 at offset 14. Now let us consider the *SLOP/x* operator in text retrieval. This operator has the syntax: *QueryTerm1 SLOP/x QueryTerm2* finds occurrences of *QueryTerm1* within $x$ (but not necessarily in that order) words of *QueryTerm2*, where $x$ is a positive integer argument ($x \\geq 1$). Thus $x = 1$ demands that *QueryTerm1* be adjacent to *QueryTerm2*.\n",

    "2. List each set of values for which the query **Obama** *SLOP/x* **Election** has a different set of documents as answers (starting from $x = 1$). \n",
    "3. Consider the general procedure for \"merging\" two term-offset inverted lists for a given document, to determine where the document satisfies a *SLOP/x* clause (since in general there will be many offsets at which each term occurs in a document). Let $L$ denote the total number of occurrences of the two terms in the document. Assume we have a pointer to the list of occurrences of each term and can move the pointer along this list. As we do so we check whether we have a hit for $SLOP/x$ (i.e. the $SLOP/x$ clause is satisfied). Each move of either pointer counts as a step. Based on this assumption is there a general \"merging\" procedure to determine whether the document satisfies a $SLOP/x$ clause, for which the following is true? Justify your answer.\n",
