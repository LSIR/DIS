    "## Probabilistic Retrieval\n",

    "Following the notation used in class, let us denote the set of terms by $T=\\{k_i|i=1,...,m\\}$, the set of documents by $D=\\{d_j |j=1,...,n\\}$, and let $d_i=(w_{1j},w_{2j},...,w_{mj})$. We are also given a query  $q=(w_{1q},w_{2q},...,w_{mq})$. In the lecture we studied that, \n",

    "$sim(q,d_j) = \\sum^m_{i=1} \\frac{w_{ij}}{|d_j|}\\frac{w_{iq}}{|q|}$ .  (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of looking at the information retrieval problem is using a probabilistic approach. The probabilistic view of information retrieval consists of determining the conditional probability $P(q|d_j)$ that for a given document $d_j$ the query by the user is $q$. So, practically in probabilistic retrieval when a query $q$ is given, for each document it is evaluated how probable it is that the query is indeed relevant for the document, which results in a ranking of the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to relate vector space retrieval to a probabilistic view of information retrieval, we interpret the weights in Equation (1) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  $w_{ij}/|d_j|$ can be interpreted as the conditional probability $P(k_i|d_j)$ that for a given document $d_j$ the term $k_i$ is important (to characterize the document $d_j$).\n",
    "\n",
    "-  $w_{iq}/|q|$ can be interpreted as the conditional probability $P(q|k_i)$ that for a given term $k_i$ the query posed by the user is $q$. Intuitively, $P(q|k_i)$ gives the amount of importance given to a particular term while querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this interpretation you can rewrite Equation (1) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$sim(q,d_j) = \\sum^m_{i=1} P(k_i|d_j)P(q|k_i)$ (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question a\n",
    "Show that indeed with the probabilistic interpretation of weights of vector space retrieval, as given in Equation (2), the similarity computation in vector space retrieval results exactly in the probabilistic interpretation of information retrieval, i.e., $sim(q,d_j)= P(q|d_j)$.\n",
    "Given that $d_j$ and $q$ are conditionally independent, i.e., $P(d_j \\cap q|ki) = P(d_j|k_i)P(q|k_i)$. You can assume existence of joint probability density functions wherever required. (Hint: You might need to use Bayes theorem)"
