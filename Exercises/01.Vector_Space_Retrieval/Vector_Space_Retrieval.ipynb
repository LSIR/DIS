The probabilistic view of information retrieval consists of determining the conditional probability $P(q|d_j)$ that for a given document $d_j$ the query by the user is $q$. So, practically in probabilistic retrieval when a query $q$ is given, for each document it is evaluated how probable it is that the query is indeed relevant for the document, which results in a ranking of the documents.\n",
